This directory contains lots of example protocols in Murphi:

dash            : the DASH multiprocessor protocols
multiset+sym    : examples using both scalarsets and multisets
mux             : mutual exclusion algorithms
others          : other practical systems
sci             : typical set cache coherence protocol of the
                  Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI), IEEE Std 1596-1992
secur           : security protocols
sym             : examples using scalarsets
toy             : toy examples
real            : examples using real numbers
probrules       : examples using probability-based rules; it contains:
		  lr:            Lehmann-Rabin Probabilistic Dining Philosophers,  a
				 finite horizon probabilistic property is verified
		  pz:            Pnueli-Zuck Probabilistic Dining Philosophers,  a
				 finite horizon probabilistic property is verified
		  prob_turbogas: a Turbogas Control System, a finite horizon 
				 probabilistic property is verified
		  lr.pctl:             Lehmann-Rabin protocol again, but a BPCTL 
				       formula with nested untils is verified
		  pz.pctl:             Pnueli-Zuck protocol again, but a BPCTL 
				       formula with nested untils is verified
                  prob_turbogas.bpctl: the Turbogas Control System again, but a BPCTL 
                                       formula with nested untils is verified
