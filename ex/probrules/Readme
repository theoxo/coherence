This directory contains four directories with examples in CMurphi 5.4 for 
the probability verification extension:

Readme                           : this file.

prob_turbogas/prob_turbogas.m    : Murphi description of a Co-Generative 
				   Electric Power Plant; it is the same as
				   the one in the ../real directory, but it
				   has a probability distribution for the
				   user demand.
prob_turbogas/Makefile           : make file to generate the verifier source
                                   and executable.

pz/dphil.m                       : Murphi description of the Pnueli-Zuck 
                                   protocol for probabilistic dining 
                                   philosophers.
pz/Makefile                      : make file to generate the verifier source
                                   and executable.

lr/dphil.m                       : Murphi description of the Lehmann-Rabin
                                   protocol for probabilistic dining 
                                   philosophers.
lr/Makefile                      : make file to generate the verifier source
                                   and executable.

prob_turbogas.bpctl, pz.bpctl, lr.bpctl has the same models but verify a
BPCTL property with nested untils (the above models, instead, verify a
probabilistic safety property).
